	<h1>Middle Aged Expats</h1>
      <p>If you had asked me 15 years ago where I would be at 40, I probably would have told you convincingly, married with children and living in a col de sac in some family friendly town in the US. </p> 
      
	  <p>Fast forward to now. I'm a <strong><span class="crazy"> 41 year old</span></strong> man with no kids, no family and a crazy plan to quit my job, start a new career as a web developer and move to lisbon next summer.<br><span class="crazy"></span>I already know what most of you are probably thinking!</em><br>
      
	  <p><strong>Where in the world is Lisbon?</strong> No. No. Seriously. It's fine. <br> You're wondering why a middle aged man would do something that he probably should've done in his 20's or 30's. <strong><span class="crazy"> Right?</span></strong><hr><br> Well, I don't believe age should prevent anyone from following your dreams. And worst case scenario.. I have to <span class="crazy">return</span> to a full time job.. </p>
